# Tintin-Setup
[Tintin++](http://tintin.sourceforge.net) scripts for running in a Mud, including:

* Multiple map heirarchy handling with travel between maps.
* "Graphical" gauge display
* Window handling (multiple swappable configurable information displays)
* Event handling (subscribe/unsubscribe multiple actions to a code event)
* Database integration
* File handling (linux)

This setup includes my scripts for [3Kingdoms mud](http://3k.org/)

**I'm in the process of setting this repository up, cleaning and re-factoring old code to work in a tidier way, so not everything may work as expected yet.**

If you want to try it out anyway, run "tt++ start.tin"
